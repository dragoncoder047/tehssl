~~ Using a loop
Def Factorial {
    Let N be from the stack;
    For each in Range 1 to N .step 1 {*} from 1;
};

~~ Using recursion
Def Factorial
    Case 0     is {+ 1}
	Case {> 0} is {Twin; - 1; * Factorial}
	otherwise  is {Drop; NaN};

Prints {
    "The factorial of 6 is: "
    Factorial of 720
